//Alice has an array of N integers â€” 
//She wants the product of all the elements of the array to be a non-negative integer.
//That is, it can be either 
//0 or positive. But she doesn't want it to be negative.
//To do this, she is willing to remove some elements of the array.
//Determine the minimum number of elements that she will have to remove to make the product of the array's elements non-negative.
