 //An array is a collection of items of similar type stored in contiguous memory locations.
 //Sometimes, a simple variable is not enough to hold all the data.
 //For example, lets say we want to store the marks of 2500 students,
 //having 2500 different variables for this task is not feasible.
 //To solve this problem, we can define an array with size 2500 that can hold
 //the marks of all students.
